            '\n<figure><figcaption>homepage <a href="http://www.sanderdesnaijer.com/">www.sanderdesnaijer.com</a></figcaption></figure><blockquote>\n<em>I recently built my developer portfolio using </em><a href="http://www.sanderdesnaijer.com/"><em>Next.js and Sanity.</em></a><em> In this post, I’ll walk you through how I set it up — from design to deployment. You’ll find the source code linked at the bottom.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Intro</strong></p>\n<p>As a developer, having a portfolio is kind of a must. I had one for years, but at some point, I deleted it — and somehow never got around to making a new one. That’s partly because most of my work has been on internal projects as a consultant, so there wasn’t much I could actually share publicly. But honestly? Perfectionism also got in the way.</p>\n<p>I kept telling myself, “This has to be the best site I’ve ever made — with the cleanest design, coolest logo, and smoothest animations.” I started sketching ideas a few times, but never finished because I was never happy enough. This time, I took a different approach: just get it done. It didn’t need to be perfect — just good enough to be useful and live. That mindset helped a lot.</p>\n<p><strong>Why I picked Next.js</strong></p>\n<p>I built the site using Next.js for a few reasons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It does server-side rendering out of the box, which helps with SEO.</li>\n<li>I already knew React, but hadn’t worked much with Next.js — so it was a good excuse to learn.</li>\n<li>I wanted to use a headless CMS, and Sanity plays nicely with Next.js.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Starting the project</strong></p>\n<p>Everyone says “content is king,” and in my case, I didn’t have much to show since most of my work isn’t public. But I had done some side projects in my spare time — like a <a href="https://medium.com/@sanderdesnaijer/creating-a-3d-printed-word-clock-with-minute-accuracy-c8e0fd85bd16">word clock</a> and a <a href="https://medium.com/@sanderdesnaijer/building-my-first-flutter-app-challenges-and-lessons-learned-49ad913b4941">workout timer app</a>. I wrote blog posts about them on Medium, which gave me some material to use. I also had a few open-source repos that I could link. Piece by piece, it started to come together.</p>\n<p><strong>Design</strong></p>\n<p>I used Figma to design the site. It runs in the browser and feels familiar if you’ve used Illustrator or Photoshop. I started by defining the content first — knowing what needed to go on the page made designing a lot easier.</p>\n<p>I knew I wanted four pages: Home, Projects, Blog, and About. It took a few tries to land on something I liked, but once I had the basics, it was easier to build on. I also made mobile versions of the design early on, so I had a good sense of how things would look on different screens.</p>\n<figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*oPR048C-XW26c69LTC3Dig.png"></figure><p>Some parts were tricky — like making a logo. I pushed that off until the end, hoping inspiration would strike. Also, during development, I often found myself going back to tweak the design or adjust things I missed. That back-and-forth is just part of the process, and it helped keep everything in sync.</p>\n<p><strong>GitHub Setup</strong></p>\n<figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*RjBmZJSzVjVRkCP8CJq_gQ.png"><figcaption>pull requests linked to tickets</figcaption></figure>',

That mindset helped a lot.</p>\n<p><strong>Why I picked Next.js</strong></p>\n<p>I built the site using Next.js for a few reasons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It does server-side rendering out of the box, which helps with SEO.</li>\n<li>I already knew React, but hadn’t worked much with Next.js — so it was a good excuse to learn.</li>\n<li>I wanted to use a headless CMS, and Sanity plays nicely with Next.js.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Starting the project</strong></p>\n<p>Everyone says “content is king,” and in my case, I didn’t have much to show since most of my work isn’t public. But I had done some side projects in my spare time — like a <a href="https://medium.com/@sanderdesnaijer/creating-a-3d-printed-word-clock-with-minute-accuracy-c8e0fd85bd16">word clock</a> and a <a href="https://medium.com/@sanderdesnaijer/building-my-first-flutter-app-challenges-and-lessons-learned-49ad913b4941">workout timer app</a>. I wrote blog posts about them on Medium, which gave me some material to use. I also had a few open-source repos that I could link. Piece by piece, it started to come together.</p>\n<p><strong>Design</strong></p>\n<p>I used Figma to design the site. It runs in the browser and feels familiar if you’ve used Illustrator or Photoshop. I started by defining the content first — knowing what needed to go on the page made designing a lot easier.</p>\n<p>I knew I wanted four pages: Home, Projects, Blog, and About. It took a few tries to land on something I liked, but once I had the basics, it was easier to build on. I also made mobile versions of the design early on, so I had a good sense of how things would look on different screens.</p>\n<figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*oPR048C-XW26c69LTC3Dig.png"></figure><p>Some parts were tricky — like making a logo.
